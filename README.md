This is a copy of the SpaceNet v2.5r2 source code previously hosted at [spacenet.mit.edu](http://spacenet.mit.edu).

## Introduction

SpaceNet is a simulation-based software tool to design and analyze long-duration human space exploration missions. It is a product of several years of research and we hope its public release will simulate future research in this subject area and beyond.

SpaceNet 2.5r2 is research-grade code. As such, it has not received exhaustive testing during development. Though every available effort has been expended to eliminate bugs, there is a good chance that residual errors will inevitably occur.

## Installation

SpaceNet requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run. The easiest way to get started is to download one of the binary releases which packages the executable Java Archive (JAR) file. Simply double-click on the JAR to launch SpaceNet.

Alternatively, building your own version of SpaceNet requires a Java Development Kit (JDK) and Apache Maven to manage dependencies. Common Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse often provide these products in a user-friendly tool.

## Documentation

A user's guide and quick start tutorial is available in the doc/ directory.
